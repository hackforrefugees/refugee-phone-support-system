## Get started

We use [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) for development. To run it you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you haven't already, go install it. npm is bundled with it.

Once installed, run `npm i` in this folder. It might take a short while to finish. Once done, simply run `npm start` to watch all development files and fire up a development server at port 8000.
